## Executive Summary

This analysis predicts exercise quality using Random Forest on accelerometer data from 6 participants performing barbell lifts in 5 different ways.

## Data Processing

- **Training data**: 19,622 observations with 160 variables
- **Test data**: 20 test cases  
- **After cleaning**: 52 predictor features
- **Classes**: A, B, C, D, E (representing different exercise forms)

## Model Building

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest with 50 trees (optimized for speed)
- **Cross-validation**: 70/30 train/validation split
- **Training size**: 13,737 observations
- **Validation size**: 5,885 observations

## Model Performance

- **Validation Accuracy**: 99.37%
- **Out-of-sample Error**: 0.63%

This represents excellent classification performance with very low error rate.

## Final Predictions

Predictions for the 20 test cases: B, A, B, A, A, E, D, B, A, A, B, C, B, A, E, E, A, B, B, B

## Model Justification

Random Forest was chosen for its:
    
    - Excellent performance on classification tasks
- Handles mixed data types well  
- Built-in cross-validation (OOB error)
- Robust to overfitting
- No need for extensive preprocessing

The model successfully distinguishes between correct and incorrect exercise forms using accelerometer data from multiple body locations.

## Conclusion

The Random Forest model achieved 99.37% accuracy on the validation set, demonstrating strong predictive performance for exercise quality classification.
